### Samplesheet Format and Usage

The samplesheet is a required input that specifies how sample and Tn5 barcodes are mapped to individual sample identifiers for demultiplexing single-cell libraries. 
Each row in the samplesheet defines a sample and the corresponding subset of barcodes used during library preparation. 
The samplesheet must be a tab-delimited text file with the following two columns:

* `sample_id`: A unique identifier for the sample.
* `ranges`: A barcode specification string consisting of two parts separated by a colon:

  * The first part corresponds to the **sample barcode index range** from the sample barcode whitelist.
  * The second part corresponds to the **Tn5 barcode index range** from the Tn5 barcode whitelist.

Both index ranges are **1-based** and support:

* Comma-separated values (e.g., `1,3,5`)
* Ranges using hyphens (e.g., `2-4`)
* Mixed formats (e.g., `1,4-6`)

These index values refer to positions in the corresponding barcode whitelist files, and will be adjusted internally to 0-based indexing to match Python conventions.

#### Example Samplesheet

```
sample_id	ranges
Sample_A	1-4:1-96
Sample_B	5,6-10:97-192
```

In this example:

* `Sample_A` uses sample barcodes at positions 1 through 4 and all 96 Tn5 barcodes (1–96).
* `Sample_B` uses sample barcodes at positions 5 and 6 through 10, and Tn5 barcodes at positions 97 through 192.

This format allows flexible specification of barcode combinations, enabling pooled demultiplexing across multiple samples in a single run.
